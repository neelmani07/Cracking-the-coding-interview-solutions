This problem was asked by Indeed.

Given a 32-bit positive integer N, 
determine whether it is a power of four in faster than O(log N) time.
*/



/*
 * A number n is a power of 4 if following conditions are met.
a) There is only one bit set in the binary representation of 
   n (or n is a power of 2)
b) The bits donâ€™t AND(&) any part of the pattern 0xAAAAAAAA
   i.e.  since there are even no of zeros in bit rep of n if n is power of 4
         so 1st 1 will be at odd position. eg 16=10000-> 1 at 5th pos

 The number 0xAAAAAAAA is a 32 bit number with all even bits 
 set as 1 and all odd bits as 0.
